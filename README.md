Consumer-Complaint-Classification
Problem: Each week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sends thousands of consumerâ€™s complaints about financial product and services to company for a response. Classify those consumer complaints into the product category it belongs to using the description of the complaint.

Solution : The goal of this project is to classify the complaint into a specified product category. Since it has multiple categories, it becomes a multiclass classification that can be solved through many of the machine learning algorithms.

Once the algorithm is in place, whenever there is a new complaint, we can easily categorize it and tell about the particular product category it belongs to.

Algorithm
The model has been evaluted based on 4 algorithm i.e)

RandomForestClassifier

LinearSVC

MultinomialNB and

LogisticRegression

The best among the four is LinearSVC with an accuracy of 87.6%.
